### Hidden in Plane Sight
When you join this order at 3rd level, your Hunter's Bane is enhanced, now applying to all extraplanar creatures. You also learn the Rite of the Veil esoteric rite. 
If you are in dim light or darkness, you may attempt to shroud yourself in the magic of the plane you are in. Make a DC 13 Stealth check. On a pass, you become magically invisible for up to 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to cancel it.

##### Rite of the Veil
Your rite damage is force damage. While the rite is active, you deal one additional hemocraft die of rite damage when you hit an extraplanar creature.

### All Seeing Eyes
Upon reaching 7th level, you gain darkvision out to 60ft, or an additional 60ft if you already have darkvision. You may spend 10 minutes performing a ritual. Upon completion, you can see invisible creatures and objects for 10 minutes out to a range of 30ft. As an action, you can allow yourself to see into a plane of your choice until the end of your turn. The location you see from is randomly dictated by the DM if it is not a plane that mimics or mirrors the Material Plane.

### Brand of the Third Eye
Beginning at 11th level, your Brand of Castigation now marks the target through the veil. If a creature affected by your Brand of Castigation shifts to another plane, you know which plane the creature is on and the rough location in the plane. While a creature is affected by your Brand of Castigation, you may use your bonus action to teleport to a location within 15ft of the creature affected.

### Blood Curse of the Jailer
At 15th level, you hone your hemocraft to bind a creature to a certain plane. You gain the Blood Curse of the Jailer for your Blood Maledict feature. This doesn't count against your number of blood curses known.

### Behind the Curtain
Starting at 18th level, as a bonus action, you can step into the Deep Ethereal, gaining a flight speed of 60ft. You can move through creatures and objects, as well as see and affect creatures in the Ethereal Plane, Deep Ethereal, and Material Plane. Creatures with True Sight can see and affect you.
If you damage or affect a creature in any way while in the Deep Ethereal, you are shifted back into the Material Plane until the start of your next turn. For each round you spend in the Deep Ethereal, you take damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die.
If you end your turn inside an object, you take 1d10 force damage. If you move to the Material Plane while inside an object, you are shunted to the nearest empty space and take force damage equal to one roll of your hemocraft die per 5ft you were moved.

When you hit with a melee or ranged weapon attack while inside the Deep Ethereal with the Rite of the Veil active, you deal an additional hemocraft die of rite damage.

#### Blood Curse of the Jailer
When a creature takes damage from you, you may use your reaction to mark it. A creature marked this way cannot magically teleport or shift planes. The marked creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success.

***Amplify*** The cursed creature takes 4d6 force damage each time it tries to teleport, and if it is sent to another plane by an ally, it is instead sent to Carceri.

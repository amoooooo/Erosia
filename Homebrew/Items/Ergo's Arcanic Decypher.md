# Erno's Arcanic Decypher 
--- 
A small floating cube, inlaid with smaller, recurring cubes. 

Once per day, you may speak the command word, and attempt to store a spell of up to 1d4 level. The creature which spoke the command word must make an intelligence check, DC 12 + the level of the spell to be copied. Upon failure, the device shuts down and becomes nullified for 1d3 days. 

When a spell is stored, you may cast it as if you were able to cast that spell, without the need for somatic or material components. The DC for spells cast this way is 12 + your intelligence modifier, and the spell attack modifier is your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier. Once the stored spell has been cast, the object becomes mundane until the next day.

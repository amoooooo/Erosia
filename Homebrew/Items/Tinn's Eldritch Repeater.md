# Tinn's Eldritch Repeater (Upgradeable)
---
A small, ornate, vaguely pistol shaped metal frame with crystals dotted throughout.

Upon using the Create Eldritch Cannon ability, you may instead target this object, infusing it with the magic of the choice of cannon. The magical infusion follows the rules of the Eldritch Cannon, but can be active indefinitely if you so choose.
Using the Eldritch Cannon now requires an Attack, as you are firing the magic like a projectile weapon.

Once per day, as a bonus action, you may swap the cannon type infused into this frame. 
The channeling nature of this frame causes some changes to the cannon types:
- The Protector cannon type instead fires a projectile, healing just the targetted creature for the amount.
- The Force Ballista cannon type can be fired as many times as you can attack in your attack action.
- The Flamethrower cannon type takes your action, as if you are casting a spell.

### Staff of Thorns

_Staff (requires attunement by a druid)_

This staff is created by imbuing a branch with nature's power and molding its shape while the branch grows. Using the magic of the attuned druid, the staff grows 6-inch-long thorns. The staff has 8 charges; it regains 1d4 + 1 charges when you finish a short rest, and 1d6 + 1 charges when you finish a long rest.

You can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and fire a spike from the staff at a target within 20 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. If it hits, the target takes 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier piercing damage.

# Blackthorn

_Requires attunement by a druid_

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls. This staff deals piercing damage rather than bludgeoning damage, but otherwise retains the normal properties of a quarterstaff.

The staff has 10 charges that can be used for the following abilities. Once per turn, the user can take 1 of the following actions while holding the staff:

-   **Thorny Grasp.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to grapple a target. On a successful hit, the tangle of thorny branches at the end of the staff forms a large hand and grasps the target. If the target is large or smaller, it is grapped (the DC to escape is the same as your spell save DC) and restrained until the grapple ends. On subsequent turns, while restraining the target with at least one hand holding the staff, you can use a bonus action to deal 1d6 piercing damage. Until this restraint ends, the user can't use the staff on another target.
    
-   **Deathâ€™s Touch.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 3 charges to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
    
-   **Helpful Hand.** You can use your action to control the hand and perform simple tasks with a reach of 10 feet. The hand can't wield a weapon, activate magical items, or carry more than 30 pounds. This maneuver does not use any charges.
    

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.

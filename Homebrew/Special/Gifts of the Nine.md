**Gift of the Torrent Queen**:

**Basic**: When you hit with an attack, you may use your reaction to bolster it with the force of waves. The attack deals an additional 1d4 force damage. You may activate this ability for 1 minute using your bonus action, adding this bonus to each attack made during that time. This bonus increases to 1d6 when you reach 7th level, and 1d8 when you reach 11th level.

**Attuned**: You may use your bonus action to target a point or creature within 30ft of you. The next time you move and your feet are not touching the ground, you may swing around the point on a rope made of rushing water. This uses 10ft of movement per 90 degrees. You can use your action to attempt to pull the creature you targeted. The creature must make a DC 15 STR save or be pulled 10ft towards you.

The tether disappears at the beginning of your next turn.

**Mastered**: You may cast the Maelstrom spell. You do not concentrate on this casting of the spell, and it is cast at 5th level. Once you use this feature you cannot use it again until you have taken a long rest.

## Recap of Last Session

Met [[Hugh Accord]], who is a mute shopkeeper who communicates by joyous mental feelings who told the party is from a metal ring, and hinted that it may be used as a collar or something like that. 
Given a journal which is in common and Netherese, talking about machinations and such. Netherese is unintelligible to most, requires certain decryption to read.
Met [[Warryn Offund]], very very short gnome alchemist in mad visions who barely recognised the metal and creature but knows its from the lower planes.
[[Vishara]] told the party to meet her in [[Port Amarilis]] once they have more corpses and more metal discs, or at least some more information to go on. She disappeared into a paper teleportation circle.

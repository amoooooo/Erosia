## Introduction
Welcome to Sasia. The year is 892PD, or Post Descension. A beautiful continent which is rumoured to once be a home to the gods, now split by the hands of many varied, but extremely powerful leaders, all with differing interests. At the core of this ancient landmass, sits the sprawling Weitlauf Grassland, a seemingly endless expanse of fields, which upon it sits the forefront of western civilisation, the ever-white city of [Eischen](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FCities%2FEischen%2FEischen), which is often nicknamed the Marble Citadel, as the throne is said to be made of pure white stone. Upon which, sits [King Silas Lamonis](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FCities%2FEischen%2FPeople%2FKing%20Silas%20Lamonis), the ruler of the [Lamonian Empire](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FFactions%2FLamonian%20Empire%2FLamonian%20Empire). Together with the several military houses under the empire, the surrounding towns and villages are kept safe and protected from outsiders, as well as being home to the west's only Arcanics engineers.

To the east, lies the [[Tattered Coast]], a broken and dangerous shoreline that stretches across the entire continent from north to south, upon which sits the culturally diverse [Port Amarilis](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FCities%2FPort%20Amarilis%2FPort%20Amarilis). A city so large many non-natives mistake it for the capital. Split between two sides of the [[Braktim Mountain]], sit the twin districts. On the east, sits the Biz District. A place rife with large businesses and grassroots startups. To the west, lies the Booze District, which, well, you can guess what goes on here. The city is well known for its hands off plutocracy, the Velvet Veil.

To the southwest, a sprawling sea of immeasurably large mountains stretches into the horizon, known as the [Monolith Peaks](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FPlaces%20of%20Interest%2FMonolith%20Peaks%2FMonolith%20Peaks), where the dwarven city of [Skaule](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FCities%2FSkaule%2FSkaule) sits at the base of the [[Adamamhine]] (adamavine) with rich flora and fauna, ruled by the [[Dhamhine Crown]]. And at the apex, sits an odd outcropping none have lived to explore.

Following along to the southwest, the [Jungles of Balzar](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FPlaces%20of%20Interest%2FJungles%20of%20Balzar%2FJungles%20of%20Balzar) consume the remaining outcropping of the continent, hiding anything which lays within with dense jungle flora and a thick mist which not even magic may penetrate. Within, sits the rooftop city of [Ixqe](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FCities%2FIxqe%2FIxqe), home to mysterious races which are rarely seen throughout the rest of the world. 

On the opposite side of Sasia, to the north, an endless sea of beastial warrior-tribes, which call the [Ahau Steppe](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FPlaces%20of%20Interest%2FAhau%20Steppe%2FAhau%20Steppe) their home. The rugged badlands and cliffs prove these plains to be difficult to survive, but the City of Beasts [Namaro](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FCities%2FNamaro%2FNamaro) has proven otherwise, against all odds. Ruled by the [Steelshroud Legionnaires](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FFactions%2FLamonian%20Empire%2FSteelshroud%20Legionnaires%2FSteelshroud%20Legionnaires), the city is home to the continents most powerful militia-for-hire, against which not even the [Lamonian Empire](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FFactions%2FLamonian%20Empire%2FLamonian%20Empire) compete for dominance.

The history of Sasia is vibrant and feels endless, often coalescing in warfare beginning from an insular school of thought. Warfare is commonplace, albeit more akin to bickering nowadays, since the [Lamonian Empire](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FFactions%2FLamonian%20Empire%2FLamonian%20Empire) took hold of Arcanic engineers from the eastern sister continent, [Ream](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FReam%2FReam) 

This story, however, begins in the southeast of the Weitlauf Grassland, where the [Talgol Forest](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FPlaces%20of%20Interest%2FTalgol%20Forest%2FTalgol%20Forest) pulses with life and wonder. Here, lies the town of Calderwood, a town of hunting, fishing, and agriculture, home to [The Meillion](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FFactions%2FThe%20Meillion%2FThe%20Meillion), a tetrarchy of the leaders of each trade house, which oversees the sparse area from the [[Tattered Coast]] to the outskirts of the [Daetun Crumbles](obsidian://open?vault=Erosian%20Explorers&file=Continents%2FSasia%2FPlaces%20of%20Interest%2FDaetun%20Crumbles%2FDaetun%20Crumbles).

Here, in Calderwood, our humble story begins

We begin in the early hours of the morning, of the first day of Sehir, in a strangely orderly run down room, in a tavern in the heart of the town, a humanoid awakens, drearily, noticing their large, metallic ally standing idle against the door.

[Tinn describes character]

Noticing the shuffling, the larger machine-person stirrs to consciousness, 
[Freeform RP]

As you leave the ramshackled room, packing up your things as you go, you slowly traverse the hallways, vaguely familiar to you from the night prior, heading towards the joint tavern hall and reception. As you near, you hear some commotion coming from down below from what sounds like the main bar. Moving forward, pushing the door open slowly as to not draw attention, you see a rowdy crowd of patrons all circled around a center creature. 

[Patrons are pestering him for worshipping a strange god that they have never heard of, freeform RP]

In this crowd, seemingly unwillingly, being tossed around like a ragdoll, is an odd creature. 

[Tavernkeep gets mad and calls over Tinn and Onyx]
At the bar, as you're walking over, you meet eyes with another patron, who, weirdly enough, also looks quite out of place. 
[Description]
The tavernkeep asks for help quieting the other patrons down, freeform rp. Once they're quiet, the tavernkeep offers a table and breakfast on the house, and waives the fee of the remaining 3, but says they should probably talk to the dragonborn as he's been sat alone all morning.

[Freeform rp]

After some chatting, a figure in a long, black, velvetine cloak approaches from the doorway of the establishment. As she nears, she swiftly grabs a chair from another nearby table and takes a seat between Tinn and Onyx. Interrupting, she says, hastily:
"Have you located the stone spiders?"
[RP]
"Ah, sorry, i got you confused with another group i had tasked with finding something for me... " [FREEFORM]
[Party leaves to go to the outskirts of town, freeform rp]
You come to a part of town that isn't really often talked about, with decrepit, broken old buildings, they seem like they could have been somewhat industrial.
As they close in on the area mentioned by the figure, anyone with a passive perception of 13 or higher hears a strange clicking sound.

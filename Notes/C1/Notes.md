Players each start on their own, running a small scenario for each, at least 2 people know eachother.

They all end up on the waterfront, at the docks. There are a few ships docked, one a vew rudimentary, ragged ship that has no regalia at all, a trading ship covered in symbology, lined with what looks like gold and some kind of blue gem, and a small sailboat. 

The ragged ship's captain is talking to a hooded figure wearing a deep blood red and black tunic. He is getting heated as the robed figure seems to pressure him, and his antsiness increases. He keeps looking back at the ship. Noises start to be heard from there, hooded figure pressures more and the ragged captain runs onto the ship, shouts into a doorway and then silence as he walks back.

After some bickering, a door on the ragged ship slams open, and a bruised and battered child runs out in dirty clothing, spriting off of the deck and into one of the alleyways around here.
Meanwhile, the captain of the trading ship, an average size human adorned in turqoise and black wearing an extravagant "pirates hat", leaps from the deck of her ship onto the ragged one, down to the captain and draws her cutlass. During this, the hooded figure seems to have slipped away.

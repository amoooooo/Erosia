**Description**:
The Velvet Veil are an enigmatic organization ruling over all trade and politics in Port Amarilis and the surrounding areas. They started out as a small almost cult like organization, but evolved into an all powerful, for the people group within a matter of a few years, which is extraordinarily fast. The previous leader of Port Amarilis, Admiral Marlo Krill, seemingly disappeared overnight while out on an expedition to [[Elmpawa]]. Within days, the Velvet Veil was in command, completely changing the then port town into a bussling cosmopolitan holiday paradise. 

Locals vary between crazed drunkards swearing on their life that there's something sinister going on, to high class business people vowing to never leave as it has done nothing but bring them greatness.

They secretly worship Shar, the Mistress of the Night. Their income is illegally imported goods from Kol'Iftar, and secrecy is funded by the Kiria Arcanum, whom buys their exported refined [[Shinestone]]. The people of the Emsrath Enclave, known as the Nari people, know of rituals done at a sister island of theirs, called [[Lamato Cay]], which involve sacrificial offerings to Shar. The Nari people's god, Karabos, is all about truth and worthiness, which is in direct opposition to what the Velvet Veil are doing.

#### Description
Calderwood is a coastal town with no port situated on the south-eastern tip of [[Sasia]], bordering the Talgol Forest. Hundreds of hunters and fishermen reside here, as the intense magic concentrated in the centre of the Talgol Forest leaks out into the surrounding wildlife, creating unique never before seen creatures in the lands of Erosia. These creatures are often sold as pets, or butchered for their otherworldly meat.
